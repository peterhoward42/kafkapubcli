*  Requirements
	*  Waits for ever on terminal user input lines
	*  Each line sent to kafka topic at host - both defined as envar
	*  Show succes/error response in response
*  High Level Design
	*  Research client mo to see if needs separate go routines
		*  Use https://github.com/segmentio/kafka-go Writer API
	*  CLI should probably send the messages to an message queue interface
	*  Go routines and clean close down - don't abs need - so don't bother yet
*  Start with recommended app template 
*  Put in simple go makefile from umli to do linting etc
o  work up from cmd
	*  hello world cmd runnable from make run
	*  fetch config
	o  instantiate kafka prod based on config
	o  define a repl type with a NewRepl that takes a Producer IF arg
	o  make the repl loop and echo input
	o  make the repl write to kafka
	o  make make run trigger build
o  add tests
